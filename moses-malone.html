The New York Times called him “the first high schooler in modern basketball to go directly to the pros”. He began his professional career with Utah in the 1974–75 season after signing a five-year contract worth $1&nbsp;million. At 6&nbsp;ft 10&nbsp;in (2.08&nbsp;m) and a somewhat skinny 215 pounds (98&nbsp;kg) at the time, Malone began his professional career playing at forward until he bulked up enough to handle the rigors at center.

He landed in the NBA with the Buffalo Braves, who traded him after two games to the Houston Rockets. Malone became a five-time All-Star in six seasons with the Rockets. After leading the NBA in rebounding in 1979, he was named league MVP for the first time. He led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981, and won his second MVP award in 1982. Traded to Philadelphia the following season, he repeated as MVP and led the 76ers to the 1983 championship.
