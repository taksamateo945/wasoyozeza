(everybody)<br>I guess I had to go to that place<br>Come take my hand (come take my hand)<br>To get to this one<br>We’ll walk this road together, through the storm<br>Now some of you might still be in that place<br>Whatever weather, cold or warm<br>If you’re tryna get out (just lettin’ you know that you’re not alone)<br>Just follow me (holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road)<br>I’ll get you there</p><p>You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay ’em<br>But you won’t take the sting out these words before I say ’em<br>‘Cause ain’t no way I’ma let you stop me from causin’ mayhem<br>When I say I’m a do somethin’, I do it<br>I don’t give a damn what you think<br>I’m doin’ this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans<br>It’s gassed up, if it thinks it’s stoppin’ me<br>I’ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly<br>And all those who look down on me, I’m tearin’ down your balcony<br>No if, ands or buts, don’t try to ask him why or how can he<br>From “Infinite” down to the last “Relapse” album he’s still shittin’<br>Whether he’s on salary, paid hourly until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him<br>Whichever comes first, for better or worse<br>He’s married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas<br>His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he’s got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt<br>And fuck the whole universe</p><p>I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)<br>To take a stand (to take a stand)<br>Everybody (everybody)<br>Come take my hand come (come take my hand)<br>We’ll walk this road together, through the storm<br>Whatever weather, cold or warm<br>Just lettin’ you know that you’re not alone<br>Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road</p><p>Okay, quit playin’ with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap<br>I shouldn’t have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it’s a wrap<br>You said you was king<br>You lied through your teeth, for that, fuck your feelings<br>Instead of gettin’ crowned you’re gettin’ capped, and to the fans<br>I’ll never let you down again, I’m back<br>I promise to never go back on that promise<br>In fact, let’s be honest, that last “Relapse” CD was eh<br>Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground<br>Relax, I ain’t goin’ back to that now<br>All I’m tryna say is get back, click-clack, blaow, ’cause I ain’t playin’ around<br>There’s a game called circle and I don’t know how<br>I’m way too up to back down<br>But I think I’m still tryna figure this crap out<br>Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn’t, this fuckin’ black cloud<br>Still follows me around but it’s time to exercise these demons<br>These muh’fuckers are doin’ jumpin’ jacks now</p><p>I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)<br>To take a stand (to take a stand)<br>Everybody (everybody)<br>Come take my hand come (come take my hand)<br>We’ll walk this road together, through the storm<br>Whatever weather, cold or warm<br>Just lettin’ you know that you’re not alone<br>Holla

up, I’ma hold my ground<br>I’ve had enough, now I’m so fed up<br>Time to put my life back together right now (now)</p><p>It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me<br>Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you<br>So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through<br>And don’t realize what you did, (’cause) believe me you<br>I been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger<br>I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of<br>My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead<br>No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on<br>I promise to focus solely on handlin’ my responsibilities as a father<br>So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it<br>You couldn’t lift a single shingle on it, ’cause the way I feel<br>I’m strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub<br>And lift the whole liquor counter up ’cause I’m raising the bar<br>I’d shoot for the moon but I’m too busy gazin’ at stars, I feel amazing and I’m not</p><p>I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)<br>To take a stand (to take a stand)<br>Everybody (everybody)<br>Come take my hand come (come take my hand)<br>We’ll walk
