This might be one of the most controversial anime in history, with audiences having two extremes: either loving the show or hating it completely. So how many seasons does <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Darling in the Franxx</a></i> have? This post-apocalyptic themed anime season had 24 episodes in its first season. Here is everything you need to know about it.</p><h2>About <i>Darling in the Franxx</i> Season</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/e7bb0dcce84708cb.jpg><p class=align-left>Atsushi Nishigori directed the first season of <i>Darling in the Franxx</i> sequel. It is a science fiction story that screens a post-apocalyptic situation where humanity is at risk. In the show, humans are attacked by giant ferocious creatures knows as <i>klaxosaurs</i>. The <i>klaxosaurs</i> have almost wiped out every last remnant of human life that remains. The show follows humanity as they are almost at the edge of extinction. The remnants have grouped and named themselves <i>ape</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Hiro is the main protagonist of the show. He is on a mission to rescue humanity, but the journey ahead is not easy. What will be the consequences? This is expected in the next premiere. The first premiere had given out some of the best thrilling sequences to the viewers. But the big question is, when is <i>Darling in the Franxx Season 2 </i>announcement date? Read below to find out!</p><h3><i>Darling in the Franxx</i> Season 2 release date</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/761ff93b7f72a786.jpeg><p class=align-left>Has<i> Darling in Franxx</i> ended? While the anime had excellent reviews and was watched by millions of people globally, people are still hopeful that there will be a season 2. Being a <a href=#>co-production</a> between Studio Trigger and CloverWorks, there are high chances that either of them will go ahead with the season 2 production. The good thing is that there is an insatiable demand for another premiere.</p><p class=align-left>When the first series concluded in July 2018, fans were hopeful and expecting the next season to premiere in late-2019 or latest, mid-2020. Nevertheless, <i>Darling in the Franxx </i>has not released any commutation on the scheduled release date. That leaves the fans with the option of being patient. There is an optimistic prediction that it will be released in late 2021, but a more realistic one would be early or mid-2022.</p><p class=align-left>How many episodes are there in <i>Darling in the Franxx Season 2</i>? It is hard to predict as the <i>Darling anime season 2</i> has not yet been released. But if it happens to be released, the chances are that it will have 24 episodes, just like the first premiere.</p><h3>The expected storyline of season 2</h3><p class=align-left>Although there has been no announcement about season 2, there are many things fans would expect. In season 1, remnants tried their best to rebuild their <a href=#>world</a>, and the main villain promised to return one day. It is, therefore, easier to predict that in 2, villains will be returning, creating more trouble. In addition, we speculate there is even more adventure and thriller elements with destruction. But, these are just speculations as plot details are not yet released.</p><h3><i>Darling in the Franxx:</i> cast</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/0a946a77099fe30b.jpg><p class=align-left>Below are the <a href=#>main characters</a> who graced the show. There are high chances they will also feature in season 2 if it happens to be released. See them below!</p><ul><li><strong>Hiro</strong> – He is the primary protagonist of the series. He was in a relationship with Zero.</li><li><strong>Zero Two</strong>- She is referred to as the war hero, the primary heroine, and a supporting character.

Besides his deep affection for food, Futoshi does his best because he wants to protect Kokoro.</li><li><strong>Ichigo</strong>- As Squad 13’s <a href=#>commanding officer</a>, she led the team. She manages to alienate Zero Two the most in the entire squad.</li><li><strong>Goro</strong>- He was previously known as Parasite 056 of Thirteenth Plantation.

His partner was a girl called Miku, and they piloted the Franxx Argentea.</li></ul><h3>Why is <i>Darling in the Franxx</i> so hated?</h3><p class=align-left>The simple answer to this question will be due to show being involved majorly in the character development sacrificed the plot development. In the story, each character has problems related to something and different personalities.</p><p class=align-left>Will there be a <i>Darling and the Franxx season 2</i>? While we certainly hope for <i>Darling in the Franxx Season 2</i>, the future does not look promising. A renewal of the same seems unlikely, owing to how the premiere ended and the logical restrictions associated with the COVID 19 pandemic. But despite all, it was a great show that we all hope to see returning to the screen.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#><i>House of Zwide</i> Teasers for October 2021: Drama at the fashion house intensifies</a></p><p class=align-left>In other news, <a href=#>We</a> reported on September 28, 2021, about the <a id=https://briefly.co.za/110487-house-zwide-teasers-october-2021-drama-fashion-house-intensifies.html href=#><i>House of Zwide</i> </a>teasers for October 2021.
